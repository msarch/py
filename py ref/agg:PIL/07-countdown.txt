Creating a Countdown Timer Video


Using the python script below you can create one yourself, in any color and duration. You will need some free software packages to run the script and make a video of the generated frames.

Software requirements :

You must have the same version number (eg. 2.6) of these programmes installed:
- Python
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Aggdraw

To create a video out of the images, you could use VirtualDub to open the first frame, then set the framerate, choose compression (Xvid for example), save as avi. I made some sound beeps using Audacity. This is all free to download.

Finally you will need a TrueType font in the same folder as the .py script file. The name of the .ttf font should match the one in the script. I used the free Liberation font. Its monospaced.

Creating the images
Save the script below as a .py file. Edit it to your wish (like bgcolor and countdown time) and set the correct font name (now it is LiberationSans-Bold.ttf). Doubleclick the .py file and many frames are saved in a subfolder. This could take a while for high resolutions. Somehow it is quite slow at saving.
