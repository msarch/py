The idea of these examples is for providing an easy, fast, and encouraging learning of Shoebot.

The examples from me doesn't follow PEP8 rules (at least for now). It's because i grown since childhood as one-line coder (bad habits from 8bit ansi-basic coding), but with concern on having them as simple as not needing remarks for explaining, and having them fitted into few hundred bytes, or not much more than it.
