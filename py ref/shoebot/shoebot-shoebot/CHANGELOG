v0.2
====
  Shoebot got the love of some very talented hackers, and a truckload of lovely
  features saw the light of day:

  New features:
    * colors can be specified using hexcolour values (e.g. #FF00FF)
    * fill and/or stroke values can be specified using keyword arguments (e.g. 
      a = Rect(x,y,w,h,fill='#FF00FF'))
    * experimental animation support
    * internationalization 
    * transforms were overhauled, and are now fully consistent with Nodebox
      behaviour
    * clipping paths!
    * a powerful text API was introduced using Pango, matching and even 
      extending Nodebox's capabilities, and working great with transforms
    * image support is now there, and working great!
    * ximport() can now be used to import Nodebox's libraries
    * many Nodebox libraries ported and included in Shoebot! Boids, Cornu,
      Database, Ants, Photobot, Supershape, SVG and Web are fully working (as
      far as we could determine! :) ; Colors and L-System are partially working. 
    * easteregg(x,y,size) ;)
    * GIMP colour palette import!
    * repeat mode (-r) in commandline mode to output multiple images
    * fullscreen mode!
    * new example scripts
    * Shoebot now runs on Windows, and the IDE too! 
    * new goodies in the Shoebot IDE: error reporting console, layout 
      dimensions, about item, file dialogue, Ctrl+F shortcut, GNOME Desktop
      entry
    * preliminary mouse events implementation in GTK mode

  Bug fixes:
    * drawpath() and findpath() are working; drawpath() can be used with images
      as well (load once, use many times)
    * bounding box calculations for line() are fixed
    * fixed order of buttons on quit - save file dialogue in shoebot-ide
  
  API changes:
    * big rewrite of the code structure; now there are generic Bot and Canvas 
      classes, equivalent to a 'context' and a 'surface', but differently named
      to avoid confusion with Cairo; those can be subclassed to implement new
      languages (see NodeBot class for the implementation of Nodebox) and new
      graphical backends (see CairoCanvas).
    * the 'Box' class was renamed to 'Bot'
    * oval() deprecated and introduced ellipse(), the correct term for this
      operation
