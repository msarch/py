Virtualenv setup

Virtualenv lets you isolate python libraries from the global python 
installation and other python libraries.

If you want to develop with or on shoebot virtualenv and pip are a great
way of doing it.


To install a virtualenv environment:

$ virtualenv shoebot-env

Your prompt will then change

(shoebot-env) $



Global Requirments:

PyGtk doesn't support installation in a virtualenv and will need to be
installed using your usual package manager


Install the shoebot requirements:

(shoebot-env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt


Install shoebot in virtualenv:

(shoebot-env) $ cd ..
(shoebot-env) $ python setup.py
