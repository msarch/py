.SH NAME
sbot \- Shoebot command line rendering tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sbot
.RI [ options ] " inputfile.bot"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This manual page documents briefly the
\fBsbot\fR
command\.
.PP
Shoebot is a pure Python graphics robot: It takes a Python script as
input, which describes a drawing process, and outputs a graphic in a
common open standard format (SVG, PDF, PostScript, or PNG)\. It has a
simple text editor GUI, and scripts can describe their own GUIs for
controlling variables interactively\. Being pure Python, it can also
be used as a Python module, a plugin for Python\-scriptable tools such
as Inkscape, and run from the command line\. This man page focuses on
the \fBsbot\fR command line runner\.
.SH "OPTIONS"
