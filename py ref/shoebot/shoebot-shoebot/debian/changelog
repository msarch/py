shoebot (0.2-1) lucid; urgency=low

  * colors can be specified using hexcolour values (e.g. #FF00FF)
  * fill and/or stroke values can be specified using keyword arguments (e.g. a = Rect(x,y,w,h,fill='#FF00FF'))
  * experimental animation support
  * internationalization
  * transforms were overhauled, and are now fully consistent with Nodebox behaviour
  * clipping paths!
  * a powerful text API was introduced using Pango, matching and even extending Nodebox's capabilities, and working great with transforms
  * image support is now there, and working great!
  * ximport() can now be used to import Nodebox's libraries
  * many Nodebox libraries ported and included in Shoebot! Boids, Cornu, Database, Ants, Photobot, Supershape, SVG and Web are fully working (as far as we could determine! :) ; Colors and L-System are partially working.
  * easteregg(x,y,size) ;)
  * GIMP colour palette import!
  * repeat mode (-r) in commandline mode to output multiple images
  * fullscreen mode!
  * new example scripts
  * Shoebot now runs on Windows, and the IDE too!
  * new goodies in the Shoebot IDE: error reporting console, layout dimensions, about item, file dialogue, Ctrl+F shortcut, GNOME Desktop entry
  * preliminary mouse events implementation in GTK mode 

  Bug fixes:

  * drawpath() and findpath() are working; drawpath() can be used with images as well (load once, use many times)
  * bounding box calculations for line() are fixed
  * fixed order of buttons on quit - save file dialogue in shoebot-ide 

  API changes:

  * big rewrite of the code structure; now there are generic Bot and Canvas classes, equivalent to a 'context' and a 'surface', but differently named to avoid confusion with Cairo; those can be subclassed to implement new languages (see NodeBot? class for the implementation of Nodebox) and new graphical backends (see CairoCanvas?).
  * the 'Box' class was renamed to 'Bot'
  * oval() deprecated and introduced ellipse(), the correct term for this operation
