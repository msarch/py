#Usually when you want multidimensional arrays you
#don't want a list of lists, but rather a numpy array
#or possibly a dict.
#For example, with numpy you would do something like :

#import numpy
#a = numpy.empty((10, 10))
#a.fill(foo)

#numpy provides a multidimensional array type.
#Building a good multidimensional array out of lists is possible
#but less useful and harder for a beginner than using numpy.
#Nested lists are great for some applications,
#but aren't usually what someone wanting a 2d array would be best off with

#If it's a sparsely-populated array, you might be better off using a dictionary keyed with a tuple:

#dict = {}
#key = (a,b)
#dict[key] = value
#...
